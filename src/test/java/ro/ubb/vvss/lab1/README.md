# LAB 1

During this lab we will train our eye for identifying potential problems that may occur in the initial states of the development process.  
Problems are likely to appear even from the very start, and the sooner we identify them, the less likely they are to gain weight in time.  

<em> "Paza buna trece primejdia rea!" </em>
  
During this lab we will do the following:
* analyse and validate the user requirements document
* analyse and validate the design document
* analyse the source code
  
So we can catch the potential bugs from the beginning of the development phase!
